# RTSA Wi-Fi Missions

This repository will contain Wi-Fi Missions for Aaronia RTSA-Suite Pro where we only use free blocks.

Information on how to use and how they are set up etc. will be updated on this readme later.

## Missions (03/03/2024)

### Note: Use my RTSA-Suite Wi-Fi Profiles for all these missions

1.  2.4GHz with 3D Live based on Cisco Spectrum Expert consumes a lot of resources, a more basic 2.4GHz mission will be uploaded soon.

The factory mission "DefaultMission" is a great 2.4GHz live mission, use that instead if you do not need the fancy 3D block.

2.  File Reader Spectrum Expert 3D is to be used to play raw IQ files (same as 2.4GHz live mission, but for file reading)

4.  Multi-Band Sweep with zoom (based on this mission by Aaronia https://v6-forum.aaronia.de/forum/topic/full-sweep-4-bands-of-interest-within-an-own-graph/ - only difference is that I use my own profiles with correct U-NII band name, Wi-Fi and not Wifi and some different traces ++
